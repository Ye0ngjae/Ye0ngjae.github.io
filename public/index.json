[{"content":"Credentials ðŸ”— Certificate ðŸ”— Credly Badge ðŸŽ¬ YouTube Video Introduction I\u0026rsquo;ve passed the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification exam with just 2 months of preparation while working full-time as a software engineer. In this article, Iâ€™ll be sharing everything about this exam, my preparation strategies and tips. So, if you have plans on taking this exam anytime soon, read this article till the end.\nWhat is AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification With the rise of Cloud Computing, companies have constantly been shifting from running their infrastructure on-premise, to running them on cloud, which offers far more elasticity in terms of scaling and resiliency in case a disaster strikes.\nThe AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification validates your ability to design and deploy well-architected solutions on AWS, which is the leading cloud provider today. In simple terms, this exam tests your ability to propose an architecture given a specific scenario. For example: a company wants their application to continue running even if an entire AWS region, where that application was hosted, is down due to a disaster. So, how would you design their infrastructure around this use case?\nExam Format In this exam, you will get 65 questions and 130 minutes to answer them which means you get 2 mins per question. You will be graded on a percentile basis on a scale of 100 to 1000 where you will nead to score more than 720 to pass the exam. Based on this information, you can approximate that you will have to answer about 72% of the questions correctly in order to pass. You can refer this link for more details on how scoring works.\nThis exam has a pass / fail criteria. If you pass the exam, your score doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. It will only be written on your score report for your reference. It will not be mentioned anywhere on the certificate.\nThe cost of taking this exam is 150 USD and with taxes it comes up to about 177 USD. Since I took the exam in India, the amount for me was around 13,500 INR.\nMy Preparation Strategy I prepared for about 2 months while having a full-time job and simultaneously running my ðŸŽ¬ YouTube channel where I post resourceful videos every week. During these 2 months of preparatory period, I studied for about 2 hours on weekdays and 4-6 hours on weekends.\nFor preparation, I took the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Course by Stephane Maarek which is available on Udemy. While taking this course, I dumped all of the information available in the course into a Notion page.\nOnce I was done with the course, I bought three practice test packages for the AWS SAA exam on Udemy that are provided by:\n Stephane Maarek Jon Bonso Neal Davis  Each of these practice test packages contain 6 practice tests. Additionally, a free practice test is provided with the course.\nWhile taking the practice tests, I dumped the questions along with their explanations, into a Notion page, for the questions that I got wrong and the questions that I found difficult to answer. This would come in handy later when I revise everything before the exam.\nUntil now, everything was entangled in my head as I had not consumed information in an organized manner. So, I consolidated all of the information from the course and the practice tests into dense concise notes that, instead of Notion, I took on another note-taking app called Obsidian. Iâ€™ll explain why in another video. For the sake of the AWS exam, you can take your notes anywhere.\n If you want my notes, you will have to wait for some time until I figure out a way to share my Obsidian notes in a presentable format. They cannot be directly shared like Notion pages.\n Consolidating my notes took about a week and while doing so I went through all of the information again but this time with a much more idea of the concepts. Everything started making sense and I felt confident to take the AWS SAA exam. So, I revised my consolidated notes once and took the exam the next day.\nTaking the Test You can either take the test offline at a testing center or online at the comfort of your home. I would suggest you take the test offline if you have testing centers in your area. If not, then you can take the online route. I had to take this test online as there are no testing centers nearby.\n Do keep in mind that the proctoring in the online test is extremely strict and if the proctor cancels your exam, you won\u0026rsquo;t get a refund. In such a scenario, you will have to rebook and retake the test at a later date.\n Tips for taking the AWS SAA exam   Take as many practice tests as you can. They will give you an idea of the kind of topics that come up in the exam most often. Also, the questions in these practice tests match very well with the ones appearing on the actual exam.\n  The amount of information that you will have to go through to prepare for this exam is enormous. You not only need a good understanding of the various AWS resources and architectures, but you will also have to remember a lot of information. So, filtering out the irrelevant details from the dumped information and making concise notes, that you can easily revise within 1 or 2 days is crucial for this exam.\n  That\u0026rsquo;s all folks That was all about the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate exam. Up next, I have plans to take the AWS Developer Associate exam which focuses on the development aroud AWS services. As a personal milestone, I want to clear the AWS Developer Associate exam before I move to Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ for my MS.\n","permalink":"https://msh1307.kr/blog/aws-saa-certification/","summary":"Credentials ðŸ”— Certificate ðŸ”— Credly Badge ðŸŽ¬ YouTube Video Introduction I\u0026rsquo;ve passed the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification exam with just 2 months of preparation while working full-time as a software engineer.

I also gave a glimpse of my revision notes that I prepared while taking the course and practice exams on Udemy. After that video was out, I got so many comments and DMs, requesting me to share my notes, but the problem was that I took these notes using a note-taking app called Obsidian which stores them in markdown format locally on my Mac. Once I\u0026rsquo;m done editing my notes, I push them to a GitHub repository to make sure I don\u0026rsquo;t lose them if my laptop breaks.\nSo, if you want to view my notes exactly like I do, you can clone my Obsidian Vault repository and download Obsidian to render it. But, this solution isn\u0026rsquo;t elegant as it would require you to download an additional software. So, I along with my college roommate, Sarthak Narayan, had been working over the past 2 weeks on the project, Obsidian Publish using GitHub Action, which would allow us to effortlessly publish our notes as a static website.\nIt is complete and I\u0026rsquo;ve used it to publish my notes at notes.arkalim.org. Working The GitHub Action spins up a Docker container which parses and converts Obsidian markdown notes into a special markdown format understood by MkDocs, an open-source static site generator. MkDocs is actually meant for preparing documentations but works well for notes too. After the markdown files have been converted, all the images in my notes are compressed to a fraction of their original size so that they can load quickly in your web browser. A static site is then built using MkDocs and then finally deployed on Netlify. All of this happens automatically using GitHub Actions. All I have to do is update my notes and push the changes to GitHub.\nFinal thoughts Having an automated way to publish your notes online with the community is a powerful way to share knowledge. This project has also made it exceedingly easy for me to refer my notes from anywhere, which is powerful when you work on a lot of systems.\nResources  My Notes Obsidian Publish - GitHub Action Parser and Image Compressor MkDocs - Material Theme  ","permalink":"https://msh1307.kr/projects/obsidian-publish-github-action/","summary":"Intro In my video about How I cleared the AWS SAA Certification Exam, I shared my preparation strategy as well as tips to ace the exam.

Some of these books are downloaded straight from the internet and not from the Kindle store. I take highlights during my reading which I wanted to sync to my Notion workspace. There was no existing app that could do this job, so I developed my own.\nKindle exports the highlights as a file named MyClippings.txt. The NodeJS application reads the MyClipping.txt file exported by Kindle, parses it using Regex, extracts all the highlights, book names, highlight time etc and creates a JSON. It then uses Notion API to sync these highlights to a database in my Notion workspace. The app maintains a cache (JSON) containing the number of highlights synced for each book. This allows the highlights to be synced incrementally, preventing re-syncing of old highlights.\nAfter the app was received well by the open-source community and other developers contributed to improve the app, I dockerized it to make shipping the app easier. Now, the users donâ€™t have to install any dependency. They can just use the docker run command with the path to their clippings file along with their Notion API key and database ID. This would sync their highlights to their Notion database.\nAs a part of automation, I implemented auto build and deployment of containers on push to the master branch using GitHub Actions. If a developer raises a pull request and I merge it to the master branch, the GitHub workflow automatically builds the app and deploys it to GitHub packages repository.\n","permalink":"https://msh1307.kr/projects/kindle-to-notion/","summary":"ðŸ”— GitHub Description I like reading personal improvement and mindset change type books on Kindle e-reader.

Resnet-18 was used as the model with some slight modifications to the input and output layer. The model was trained on the official DLib Dataset containing 6666 images along with corresponding 68-point landmarks for each face. Additionally, I wrote a custom data preprocessing pipeline in PyTorch to increase variance in the input images to help the model generalize better. The neural network was trained for 30 epochs before it reached the optima.\nDuring inference, OpenCV Harr Cascades are used to detect faces in the input images. Detected faces are then cropped, resized to (224, 224), and fed to our trained neural network to predict landmarks in them. The predicted landmarks in the cropped faces are then overlayed on top of the original image.\n","permalink":"https://msh1307.kr/projects/face-landmarks-detection/","summary":"ðŸ”— Colab Notebook ðŸ”— Blog Post Description In this project, I trained a neural network to localize key points on faces.

This will assist the rescue team to focus on recovering the victims, leaving the locating task for the Robots. The unique features of the SRR above existing ATVs are active-articulation, modularity, and assisted-autonomy. Active-articulation allows the SRR to climb objects much tall than itself. Modularity allows the SRR to detach into smaller modules to enter tight spaces where the whole body canâ€™t fit.
